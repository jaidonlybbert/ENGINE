/* 
 * Behavior of a free body
 * - A free body has position, velocity, and acceleration
 * - Is acted on by external systems to update position, velocity, and acceleration
 *   + includes kinematic component
 */

/*
 * A kinematic system
 * - Position and velocity are calculated at a fixed timestep taking as inputs last position, acceleration, and velocity
 */

/*
 *  A system for directed force field
 *  - A vector-valued function defines the direction and magnitude of force in 3-d space
 *  - The force on each free body is evaluated at the position of the free body and mutated
 */

/*
 * A system for collisions
 * - Collision detection based on intersection algorithms between collision boxes
 */

/*
 * A system for rendering Mesh components
 * - A mesh component has vertex attributes
 * - The system loads the mesh attributes into GPU buffers
 */

/*
 * A system for operating on Camera components
